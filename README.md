Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and responsive design, with a 3x3 grid at the center of the page.

## How to Play
- Two players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Dynamic status updates to indicate the current player's turn.
- Automatic detection of win or draw conditions.
- A "Restart Game" button to reset the board and start a new game.

To play, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
